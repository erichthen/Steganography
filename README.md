## Send hidden messages through an image

---

**This is called *Steganography***:
the process of hiding information within other seemingly harmless data to conceal its existence, in this case it uses images that hide its data in a manipulated pixel distribution.  
<br>
***Steganalysis*** is the process of detecting, analyzing, and extracting the hidden message

---
### TODO:
- Use steganographic adaptive embedding to minimize changes to pixel value distributions, making the entropy differences less noticeable.
